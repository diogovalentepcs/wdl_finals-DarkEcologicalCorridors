- To start the app, execute the script “start.py”
- All the data necessary to test the app is in the folder “data”. To run for different animal species and/or cities, it is necessary to perform all the previous processing done by YODAS, resulting in the data structure that is observed in the example files of the folder “data”.
- All the previous processing that leads to the cluster creation and the cleaning of the features can be found in the YODAS notebook, also present in this drive folder.
